# Isolated-Digit-Recognition System

### a. Task 1 - Dynamic Time Warping(DTW)
In this part, the basic sequence matching algorithm DTW is implemented.

### b. Task 2 - Isolated Digit Recognition System
In this part, the Isolated digit recognition system is I built with the help of DTW algorithm in the Task 1.

The audio files of the directory Training and Testing Audio Paths, are used to train and test the system.

### c. Task 3 - Evaluation of the above-written Digit Recognition System
In this part, above-written digit recognition system's performance is evaluated on different test cases and the pros and cons of the DTW algorithm are understood.

In this part, the TDIGITS data is being used for experimenting and evaluating different aspects of the system.
